Last time the most obviously new thing was adding the @emph{What's New}
section to the HOWTO.  Now it's moving it out of the HOWTO.  Not to
mention expanding on the documentation both generally and
considerably.

Additions since GPGME 1.12.0 include:

@itemize
@item
Moving the @emph{What's New} section out of the basic @uref{gpgme-python-howto.org, HOWTO} document and
into its own file so as to more readily include other documents
beyond that HOWTO.
@item
Moving the preceding, archival, segments into @uref{what-was-new.org, another file}.
@item
Added @samp{gpg.version.versionintlist} to make it easier for Python
developers to check for a specific version number, even with beta
versions (it will drop the "-betaN" part).
